# Movie_review_analysis

NLP - Natural Language Processing is a subfield in data/computer science that deals with how computers are programmed to analyze human language. The goal of this NLP is to conduct sentiment analysis of movie reviews, a project Kaggle titled - Bag of Words Meets Bags of Popcorn. The models are to be trained to identify positive reviews and negative reviews.

The data was sourced from kaggle. It consists of 50000 movie reviews, 25000 of the reviews in the train data have labeled 'sentiment' and remaining 25000 of the review are in the test data which contains only the 'id' and the 'review' for each of the review.

I applied random forest classifier and tensorflow logistic model, both codes are in separate files
